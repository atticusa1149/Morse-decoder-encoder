# Morse-encoder-decoder

## **Intro**
This is a simple project written in Python.

## **Instructions**
It has two modes: **decode** and **encode**.

To decode, you simply paste in your Morse code, and the program will output normal text.

It is important that around the slash there is a space.  
Correct: `" / "`  
Incorrect: `"/"` or `" /"` or `"/ "`  

## **Additional <u>IMPORTANT</u> Notes**
You will notice there are two Python files:

- **Windows-only version with sound:** includes audio output but will crash on non‑Windows systems.
- **Cross‑platform version without sound:** works on all operating systems but does not include audio.
- The executable file was compiled on **Windows**.
